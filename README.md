# Property Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This repository contains files for a property price prediction project aimed at predicting real estate prices using machine learning. The project includes two main tasks: Regression to predict actual prices and Classification to predict if the price exceeds 750k.

## Files in the Repository
- `Housing_Labeled_Data.xlsx`: Labeled data for model training and testing.
- `Housing_Unlabeled_Data.xlsx`: Unlabeled data for predictions.
- `Project_File.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code, analysis, and models.

## Environment and Tools
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: [list all libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, etc.]

## Data Sourcing and Pre-Processing
Includes outlier treatment, missing value imputation, feature generation, and transformation.

## Predictive Modeling
### Task 1 - Regression
Focuses on predicting actual prices with various regression models.
### Task 2 - Classification
Determines if prices are higher than 750k using classification algorithms.

## Results
Models are compared using RMSE for regression and F1-score for classification, with a business perspective interpretation.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install necessary libraries.
3. Run `Project_File.ipynb`.
